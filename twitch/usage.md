#Using the Undocumented API
Most of the undocumented sections of Twitch's API are not under the official API's url ("https://api.twitch.tv/kraken/..."), instead most requests are sent to "http://api.twitch.tv/api/...". The documentation for API calls in this section will be preceeded by "/kraken/" or "/api/".
